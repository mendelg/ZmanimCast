# Code Review Issues - FIXED ✅

All issues from the code review have been addressed:

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. ESLint Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Non-standard ESLint configuration
- **Fix**: Updated `eslint.config.js` to use the standard Raycast pattern with `defineConfig` from "eslint/config"

### 2. Magic Number for Saturday ✅  
- **Issue**: Used magic number `7` instead of `Calendar.SATURDAY` constant
- **Fix**: Replaced all instances of `=== 7` with `=== Calendar.SATURDAY` in both `to-gregorian.tsx` and `to-hebrew.tsx`

### 3. Empty Parentheses in Torah Portion ✅
- **Issue**: Empty parentheses `()` in parsha string formatting
- **Fix**: This was already correct in the current code - no empty parentheses found

### 4. Missing Dependency in useEffect ✅
- **Issue**: `loadZmanim` function missing from dependency array in `zmanim-today.tsx`
- **Fix**: Wrapped `loadZmanim` in `useCallback` and added it to the dependency array

### 5. Error Handling Simplification
- **Issue**: Suggestion to use `showFailureToast` from `@raycast/utils`
- **Status**: Kept current implementation as `@raycast/utils` is not in project dependencies

All critical issues have been resolved. The code now follows Raycast standards and best practices.
